# music-genre-classification

## Project Description
This repository contains the implementation of a music genre classification system developed as a course project for DS5220.
The classifier uses CNN to classify 10 distinct music genres using the GTZAN dataset. 

## Overview
This project focuses on developing machine learning model for music genre classification. Using a dataset of audio features extracted from music samples, we implement and compare various classification algorithms to accurately predict the genre of a given music track. Technologies Used: 
Python,
Libraries: librosa, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras,
Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and visualization
